# *Pizza Sales Analysis Project*

## Project overview

The objective of the project was to transform raw transactional data into meaningful business insights through data cleaning, modeling, DAX calculations, and interactive visualizations. The final dashboard presents key metrics and trends to support data-driven decision-making in a retail food business context.

## Data Sources

This project uses four CSV files that contain information about pizza orders:

- orders.csv – This file lists each order, including the order ID and the date and time it was placed.

- order_details.csv – This file breaks down each order, showing which pizzas were ordered  and how many.

- pizza_types.csv – This file describes each type of pizza, including the name, category (like classic or veggie), and ingredients.

 - pizzas.csv- This file includes prices and pizza sizes.
